            Web security and you.
          </h1>
          <h3>Why should I care?</h3>

<p>About a month and a half ago a coworker pointed out that when tested against <a href="https://securityheaders.io/?q=blog.tminor.io&followRedirects=on">these standards</a>, my web site receives a failing grade. Even more, when tested against <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=blog.tminor.io">this battery of standards</a>, my site barely passed, receiving a C.</p>

<p>In reality, I could get away with trivializing these issues and ignore them altogether. This site is just a pet project that serves no mission critical purpose; it&rsquo;s not used to serve sensitive information; it doesn&rsquo;t host any web applications (at least ones that I&rsquo;ve written); I could have shrugged it off and ignored it. But no! Defeatism begets mediocrity and no one wants to be average!</p>

<hr>

<h3>Security headers and you</h3>

<p>The tests linked above examine different aspects of web security as they pertain to actual web pages. I&rsquo;ll start with <a href="https://securityheaders.io">https://securityheaders.io</a>, through which this site received a big fat &ldquo;F.&rdquo; What sort of implications underly a lack of HTTP security headers?</p>

<p><strong>HTTP basics</strong></p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s assume some measure of ignorance and establish a basic foundational knowledge (mostly for my own sake). From <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230">RFC 7230</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a stateless application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More pragmatically, HTTP is a request/response protocol that functions to deliver messages over a session-layer connection between a client and server. A client may be any of a variety of applications that submits an HTTP request to a system that runs an application that responds to said HTTP requests. A request message begins with a request line, specifying a <a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html">method token</a>, a <a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec3.html#sec3.2">Uniform Resource Identifier</a> (URI), and the protocol version, followed by header fields (which we care about for this post) and two CRLFs (Carriage Return Line Feed), indicating the expectation that the message body containing a payload is to follow (if necessary).</p>

<p><strong>What purpose do HTTP headers serve?</strong></p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll start with an example. Running <code>curl -I</code> against this site returns the following response header fields:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sun, 26 Mar 2017 15:56:39 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.6 (CentOS) OpenSSL/1.0.1e-fips
Last-Modified: Tue, 21 Mar 2017 15:36:46 GMT
ETag: &quot;12a0-54b3f6958bf80&quot;
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 4768
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
</code></pre></div>
<p>Again, from RFC 7230:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Each header field consists of a case-insensitive field name followed by a colon (&ldquo;:&rdquo;), optional leading whitespace, the field value, and optional trailing whitespace.<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many of the fields above are defined in RFC 7230 and others, but 7230 also specifies that header fields are fully extensible. As such, HTTP has a variety of header fields that are standard and non-standard. Borrowing from Wikipedia, HTTP headers serve to define operating parameters of an HTTP transaction.</p>

<p>Moving on, we will concern ourselves with header fields that prescribe methods of operation that ensure security. Taking a look at the report generated above, the header fields that are missing from an HTTP transaction with my site are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Strict-Transport-Security</li>
<li>Content-Security-Policy</li>
<li>Public-Key-Pins</li>
<li>X-Frame-Options</li>
<li>X-XSS-Protection</li>
<li>X-Content-Type-Options</li>
<li>Referrer-Policy</li>
</ol>

<p>Let&rsquo;s move on to examining and defining the function of each.</p>

<hr>

<h3>HTTP security headers</h3>

<p>Within the past few years, the web has seen a surge in malicious activity. These attacks capitalize on a wide variety of threat vectors including social engineering, software vulnerabilities, and so on. Though HTTP headers can&rsquo;t solve human gullibility, they can help to prevent other types of attacks.</p>

<p><strong>Strict-Transport-Security</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>(HSTS) defines a mechanism enabling web sites to declare themselves accessible only via secure connections and/or for users to be able to direct their user agent(s) to interact with given sites only over secure connections.<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>First, let&rsquo;s consider what sort of threat such a specification would aim to mitigate.</p>

<p><em>Passive attack</em></p>

<p>Alice is connected to the Internet via a local wireless network at a coffee shop. The AP is password protected using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11i-2004">WPA2-PSK</a>; Bob is also using the coffee shop&rsquo;s AP to access the Internet. Unfortunately for Alice, Bob is interested in malicious packet sniffing. WPA2-PSK encrypts over-the-air traffic using individualized pairwise keys derived (via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11i-2004#The_four-way_handshake">four-way handshake</a>) by concatenating a slew of variables that include (but are not limited to) the PSK, the AP&rsquo;s MAC address, and so on; unfortunately (again—Alice is very unlucky), Bob is versed in the ways of the four-way handshake and knows that—if he captures it—he can ultimately snoop Alice&rsquo;s traffic. Bob forcefully de-auths Alice and captures the four-way handshake between Alice and the AP. Bob can now decrypt Alice&rsquo;s traffic. In this case, if Alice is interacting with a website over HTTP, Bob can see any transaction between Alice and that website. Thankfully, fewer and fewer websites deliver sensitive information via HTTP (and Firefox even warns users <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2017/01/20/communicating-the-dangers-of-non-secure-http/">when they do</a>).</p>

<p><em>Active attack</em></p>

<p>As a variation on the above, let&rsquo;s consider that Bob is a little more aggressive and has managed to man-in-the-middle Alice. Bob intercepts Alice&rsquo;s traffic by virtue of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing">ARP cache poisoning</a> and attempts to use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFol6IMbZ7Y">SSLStrip</a> to force Alice&rsquo;s browser to continue its session with alicesbank.com using HTTP and proxy the connection so that he can get whatever information he needs to steal all of Alice&rsquo;s money.</p>

<p><em>HSTS to the rescue</em></p>

<p>HSTS was really born as a solution to the latter issue and proves its usefulness in such instances. Let&rsquo;s assume that Alice uses a modern browser that utilizes Google&rsquo;s <a href="https://hstspreload.org/">HSTS preload list</a>. Even if Alice had never connected to her bank&rsquo;s website—given that alicesbank.com has been added to the preload list—, Alice&rsquo;s browser will not allow her to connect in the case described above. Very nifty indeed.</p>

<p>In the case of a passive attacker, the utility of HSTS is slightly diminished. HSTS cannot control whether or not a website uses HTTPS/HSTS. In such an instance the onus is upon the user to be aware of unencrypted connections. Thankfully, browsers have taken to very prominent warnings to notify users in such instances.</p>

<p><em>Shortcomings</em></p>

<p>HSTS can be bypassed with a bit of effort. See <a href="https://finnwea.com/blog/bypassing-http-strict-transport-security-hsts">this blog post</a> for more information.</p>

<p><strong>Content-Security-Policy</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>[CSP is] a mechanism by which web developers can control the resources which a particular page can fetch or execute&hellip;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Content-Security-Policy is designed to mitigate the risk of content injection vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS). XSS exploits the basic principle underpinning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy">same-origin policy</a>, which (as an oversimplification) asserts that code from one page is permitted to access data from another if they have the same origin (where origin is defined as a URI&rsquo;s scheme, port, and host). An attacker can exploit any number of software vulnerabilities to inject malicious client-side scripts into an otherwise benign web page.</p>

<p>As an example, a miscreant could inject an HTML script source attribute to load malicious code. It&rsquo;s very common to see web pages loading code from CDNs such as Google:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.5.7/angular.min.js&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>At first I was confused by this; I wasn&rsquo;t sure exactly how this conformed to any sort of same-origin policy. In order to understand the principal of same-origin, it&rsquo;s important to distinguish that same-origin only applies in terms of the browser (i.e. only the browser cares about same-origin). A same-origin policy generally only enforces rules to prevent, for example, an iframe (a web page within a web page, more or less) from reading or modifying contents from the parent frame. This means that if a web page loads a script from an external source <em>before</em> sending it to a browser, there&rsquo;s no issue; the browser sees all of the code and content coming from the same place.</p>

<p>Hopefully this explanation makes clear how content on the server side can be exploited. Let&rsquo;s consider an example where a server doesn&rsquo;t enforce CSP.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say that Bob runs a WordPress blog. Bob has auto-updating disabled and is behind on patching and missed one of the latest <a href="https://blog.sucuri.net/2017/02/content-injection-vulnerability-wordpress-rest-api.html">WordPress vulnerabilities</a>. Alice, being a savvy ne&#39;er-do-well, has happened upon Bob&rsquo;s blog and begins to poke at it until discovering that the site is ripe for owning. Alice injects copious amounts of porn and spam, leaving Bob&rsquo;s blog a steaming cesspool.</p>

<p>For the sake of illustration, let&rsquo;s say that Bob is a consultant in the info sec space. If potential clients were to happen upon Bob&rsquo;s site, that would be a little embarassing, needless to say.</p>

<p>This probably doesn&rsquo;t bare explaining, but this hypothetical situation could have been prevented with CSP white listing. There&rsquo;s even a <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-content-security-policy/">plugin</a> so that anyone can do it!</p>

<p><strong>Public-Key-Pins</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>[HTTP Public Key Pinning] allows web host operators to instruct user agents to remember (&ldquo;pin&rdquo;) the hosts&rsquo; cryptographic identities over a period of time.<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7469"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with an example of an HTTP response that contains an HPKP field.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ curl -I https://github.com

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: GitHub.com
Date: Fri, 07 Apr 2017 19:42:32 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Status: 200 OK
&lt;snip&gt;
Public-Key-Pins: 
  max-age=5184000; 
  pin-sha256=&quot;WoiWRyIOVNa9ihaBciRSC7XHjliYS9VwUGOIud4PB18=&quot;; 
  pin-sha256=&quot;RRM1dGqnDFsCJXBTHky16vi1obOlCgFFn/yOhI/y+ho=&quot;; 
  pin-sha256=&quot;k2v657xBsOVe1PQRwOsHsw3bsGT2VzIqz5K+59sNQws=&quot;; 
  pin-sha256=&quot;K87oWBWM9UZfyddvDfoxL+8lpNyoUB2ptGtn0fv6G2Q=&quot;; 
  pin-sha256=&quot;IQBnNBEiFuhj+8x6X8XLgh01V9Ic5/V3IRQLNFFc7v4=&quot;; 
  pin-sha256=&quot;iie1VXtL7HzAMF+/PVPR9xzT80kQxdZeJ+zduCB3uj0=&quot;; 
  pin-sha256=&quot;LvRiGEjRqfzurezaWuj8Wie2gyHMrW5Q06LspMnox7A=&quot;; 
  includeSubDomains
&lt;/snip&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p>As we can see, the HPKP header field contains a <code>max-age</code> directive; this particular directive specifies the length of time which a pin is trusted by a User Agent (UA). Following this directive, we see several pin directives specifying different hash values (which are all derived via SHA-256 as this is the only hash function currently supported under RFC 7469).</p>

<p>Okay, great. But what does all of this mean and what risk does HPKP hope to mitigate?</p>

<p>Consider the breach of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DigiNotar#Issuance_of_fraudulent_certificates">DigiNotar</a>. DigiNotar was compromised in 2011 and a wildcard certificate was issued for <code>*.google.com</code> (amongst many others). The attacker was then able to man-in-the-middle Gmail users in Iran using the fraudulent cert. At the time, Google Chrome reported an error due to a missing or incorrect HPKP pin.</p>

<p>An HPKP pin is generally a hash of the Subject Public Key Info portion of an X.509 certificate. So in the case above, users were being provided with a valid cert for <code>*.google.com</code>, but the hash of the SPKI did not match the one found (or not) in the HPKP header field. Chrome reported this to the user while other browsers did not.</p>

<p><strong>X-Frame-Options</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The use of &ldquo;X-Frame-Options&rdquo; allows a web page from host B to declare that its content (for example, a button, links, text, etc.) must not be displayed in a frame (&amp;ltframe&amp;gt or &amp;ltiframe&amp;gt) of another page.<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7034#section-1"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Clickjacking—in simple terms—is a technique used to trick a user into clicking something other than what was intended by the user. An example might be the following:</p>

<p>An attacker lures an unsuspecting victim into viewing their web page via an enticing ad. Once on the page, the attacker includes a multitude of interesting hyperlinks that the user clicks on. Unbeknownst to the victim, the attacker has used an invisible iframe placed directly over the interesting hyperlink. What the victim doesn&rsquo;t know is that they&rsquo;ve unwittingly clicked a Facebook &ldquo;like&rdquo; button. Gasp!</p>

<p>This could be prevented if Facebook used X-Frame-Options in its response headers, which it does:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">HTTP/1.1 200 OK
&lt;snip&gt;
public-key-pins-report-only: max-age=500; pin-sha256=&quot;WoiWRyIOVNa9ihaBciRSC7XHjliYS9VwUGOIud4PB18=&quot;; pin-sha256=&quot;r/mIkG3eEpVdm+u/ko/cwxzOMo1bk4TyHIlByibiA5E=&quot;; pin-sha256=&quot;q4PO2G2cbkZhZ82+JgmRUyGMoAeozA+BSXVXQWB8XWQ=&quot;; report-uri=&quot;http://reports.fb.com/hpkp/&quot;
&lt;snip&gt;
X-Frame-Options: DENY
&lt;/snip&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p>(I left the <code>public-key-pins-report-only</code> to illustrate that Facebook uses a different version of the HPKP header; in this case, all violations are reported but not acted upon [i.e. the browser allows connections upon violation].)</p>

<p>In the case given above, the attacker&rsquo;s site is unable to load the Facebook &ldquo;like&rdquo; button in an invisible iframe.</p>

<p><strong>X-XSS-Protection</strong></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t really feel like going into this one too much because:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The HTTP X-XSS-Protection response header is a feature of Internet Explorer, Chrome and Safari that stops pages from loading when they detect reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Although these protections are largely unnecessary in modern browsers when sites implement a strong Content-Security-Policy that disables the use of inline JavaScript (&lsquo;unsafe-inline&rsquo;), they can still provide protections for users of older web browsers that don&rsquo;t yet support CSP.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example in an HTTP response from GitHub:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: GitHub.com
Date: Sat, 08 Apr 2017 12:18:34 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Status: 200 OK
&lt;snip&gt;
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
&lt;/snip&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p>IE 8 was the first to implement this feature, followed by Safari and Chrome using XSS Auditor. I&rsquo;m not sure how IE works, but you can find the source code for XSS Auditor <a href="https://github.com/WebKit/webkit/blob/master/Source/WebCore/html/parser/XSSAuditor.cpp">on Github</a>. Simply put, the browser uses heuristics to detect common patterns of XSS attacks and blocks them.</p>

<p><strong>X-Content-Type-Options</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The X-Content-Type-Options response HTTP header is a marker used by the server to indicate that the MIME types advertised in the Content-Type headers should not be changed and be followed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since I was completely ignorant of this prior to starting this section, I&rsquo;m going to go into some detail.</p>

<p>Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) was initially designed as an extension to SMTP in order to provide facilities to represent body content in character sets other than US-ASCII (which did not provide for transmission of extended character sets; 7-bit characters as opposed to 8-bit). RFC 1341 includes <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1341#page-2">specifications for RFC 822 header fields</a> (and body part headers&hellip; very confusing), one of which is the Content-Type field, which is intended to describe data contained within the body such that a UA can suitably choose a mechanism by which to present the data.</p>

<p>Though MIME was originally intended as an extension upon SMTP, it is also used by other Internet protocols for similar purposes. As an example, a server may say &ldquo;this is data, and its MIME type is <code>image/jpg</code>.&rdquo; In Java, it would appear as:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="c1">// Response is of type javax.servlet.ServletReponse</span>
<span class="n">response</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setContentType</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;image/jpg&quot;</span><span class="o">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The browser then knows how to handle the data. In the example, the browser can render the data internally, whereas if the data were presented as MIME type <code>application/pdf</code>, it would know to render the data with whatever the browser knows as the PDF handler.</p>

<p>Alright, so what does X-Content-Type-Options do?</p>

<p>When this header field is absent, some browsers will practice &ldquo;content sniffing,&rdquo; which involves the browser guessing MIME types by examining a byte stream (which generally employs a mixture of heuristics, file signatures, etc.). This imposes a security risk; a browser may improperly interpret data types provided by an attacker, allowing the possibility for a XSS attack (see <a href="http://www.adambarth.com/papers/2009/barth-caballero-song.pdf">this old paper</a>). All of this can be avoided by including the X-Content-Type-Options header field:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ curl -I https://www.facebook.com

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
&lt;snip&gt;
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
&lt;snip&gt;
Content-Type: text/html
&lt;/snip&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Referrer-Policy</strong></p>

<p>Referrer-Policy allows a site to send reference information for instances where a user clicks a hyperlink away from the site to another. When a user clicks a link, the browser sends a request that includes the referrer information. Referrer logging can then be used for analytics to identify traffic patterns for promotional and statistical purposes.</p>

<p>(Interesting trivia: the Referrer-Policy referrer field is represented as <code>referer</code>, a misspelling that originated in the initial proposition to incorporate the header in the HTTP specification.)</p>

<p>The logging of this information raises some privacy concerns. Scott Helme (the author of securityheaders.io) <a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/a-new-security-header-referrer-policy/">indicates</a> that a site can&rsquo;t receive an A+ without a &ldquo;good policy.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m kind of unclear on what constitutes a &ldquo;good&rdquo; policy; I&rsquo;ll examine that in my next post where I hope to implement these headers.</p>

<h3>END</h3>

<p>Alright, this has gone on long enough. In the next post, I&rsquo;ll try to stick to an illustration of how to implement the headers above via Apache configs. Oh yeah, I&rsquo;ll also explain the results of the tests from <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=blog.tminor.io">Qualys</a>.</p>
