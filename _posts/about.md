Welcome to my blog! My name is Thomas Minor. Here you'll find documentation and thoughts concocted throughout the process of completing projects in my homelab. I'm currently working my way through [this outline](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/2s924h/how_did_you_get_your_start/cnnw1ma/) and I aim to chronicle the journey along the way; follow the bouncing ball and enjoy the ride!
