* Ooo, so trendy!

I started delving into the world of IT about a year and half or two years ago; part of that delve included regular listening to particular tech podcasts, and though I was
mostly lost in the jargon at first, I began to pick up on fads and trends in the frequency of certain topics. One of those was Docker (and containers in general). I didn't have much of an understanding 
for what Docker was at the time, but I did hear frequent comparisons between Docker and virtualization. As I've learned more, I've started to understand that there was often
a false equivalence being perpetrated when discussing the two; any discussion would generally include such a question as "are containers the future?" Maybe the answer is yes,
but I don't think I heard enough discussion regarding the utility of one versus the other; that it may be more pragmatic in one instance to use a VM than to use a container,
and vice versa. 

** What's the difference?

Let's consider, very broadly, the differences between containers and virtualized machines. One of the most obvious differences is how each of the two handle an operating system.
Containers utilize the host operating system

** Installing Docker on OS X

First, let's use =brew= to install Docker:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results code
$ brew install docker
#+END_SRC

Here's the output:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
