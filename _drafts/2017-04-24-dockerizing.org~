* Ooo, so trendy!

I started delving into the world of IT about a year and half or two years ago; part of that delve included regular listening to particular tech podcasts, and though I was
mostly lost in the jargon at first, I began to pick up on fads and trends in the frequency of certain topics. One of those was Docker (and containers in general). I didn't have much of an understanding 
for what Docker was at the time, but I did hear frequent comparisons between Docker and virtualization. As I've learned more, I've started to understand that there was frequently
a false equivalence being perpetrated when discussing the two; any discussion would generally include such a question as "are containers the future?" Maybe the answer is yes,
but I don't think I heard enough discussion regarding the utility of one versus the other&Mthat it may be more pragmatic in one instance to use a VM than to use a container,
and vice versa
